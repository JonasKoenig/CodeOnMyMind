# LaTeX Cheat Sheet

Now for the science part in computer science. Most scientific papers are written in LaTeX, a mark up language from the 80s. This cheat sheet is a collection of useful things I encountered during my studies.

## Cheat Sheet

I begin by explaining basics like structuring the document, lists, tables and figures and work my way to more advanced techniques. To provide more examples than the actual cheat sheet I supply both latex (`cheat-sheet.tex`) and pdf (`cheat-sheet.pdf`) documents.

I might add more in the future and will try to keep this version up to date. For a live version of this project see the [Overleaf-Project](https://www.overleaf.com/read/pcpwsxtmdphs).

## Overleaf

Overleaf is a useful online tool for LaTeX projects. There is no software required. You just create your document and download the resulting PDF. It allows for real-time collaboration and supplies templates and auto-completion for beginners and lazy veterans. And _no_ I do not get paid to say this :)
