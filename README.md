# Code On My Mind

My name is Jonas and I study computer science in Tübingen, Germany. My Goal is to make programming more accessible and keep track of techniques I learned. All of the following projects have a README file in which I explain the required insights. Feel free to reuse and modify any code you see here.

## Projects

These links list all of my projects. You can download the source code for all projects at once using GitHubs own 'Clone or Download' button at the top of this page (also see: [GitHub Beginners Guide](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)). Use [DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home) to get the code for a single project.
