# Code On My Mind

My name is Jonas and I am a computer science MSc based in Tübingen, Germany. My Goal is to make programming more accessible and keep track of techniques I learned. All of the following projects have a README file in which I explain the required insights. Feel free to reuse and modify any code you see here.

## Projects

These links list all of my projects. You can download the source code for all projects at once using the 'Clone' button above (also see: [GitHub Beginners Guide](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)).
