# Code On My Mind

My name is Jonas and I study Computer Science in Tübingen, Germany. I am creating this repository to keep track of nifty code snippets and techniques I learned. I share this with you, not because something like this has never been done before, but to practice explaining code I wrote. Feel free to reuse and modify any code you see here.
