# CodeOnMyMind
My name is Jonas and I study Computer Science in TÃ¼bingen, Germany. I am creating this blog to keep track of nifty code tricks and techniques I learned. I share this with you, not because something like this has never been done before, but to practice explaining code I wrote. Also check out my Tumblr: https://codeonmymind.tumblr.com/
