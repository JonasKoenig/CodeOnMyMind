# Code On My Mind

My name is Jonas and I study Computer Science in Tübingen, Germany. I am creating this repository to keep track of nifty code snippets and techniques I learned. I share this with you, not because something like this has never been done before, but to practice explaining code. Feel free to reuse and modify any code you see here.

## How I explain code

<details>
<summary>Provide context</summary>
In an effort to appeal to a wider audience, I decided to write a short intro for every project. Explaining _what_ I do is the point of this repository. Explaining _why_ I do it is what makes it worth your while. I find that providing a little context goes a long way.
