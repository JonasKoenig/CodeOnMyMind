# Code On My Mind

My name is Jonas and I study Computer Science in Tübingen, Germany. I am creating this repository to keep track of nifty code snippets and techniques I learned. I share this with you, not because something like this has never been done before, but to practice explaining code. Feel free to reuse and modify any code you see here.

## History

The full history of this repository aims to show how this repository developed and which projects were added when. You can download the source code for all projects at once using GitHubs own 'Clone or Download' button at the top of this page (also see: [GitHub Beginners Guide](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)). Use [DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home) to get the code for a single project.
