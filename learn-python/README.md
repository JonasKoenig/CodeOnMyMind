# Learn Python

In my opinion Python is a great language for both beginners and veterans. It has a very easy syntax resulting in a steep learning curve. Shorthands allow more experienced programmers to write elegant code using only a few lines of code.

<summary><b>Installation</b></summary>

Beware of the two Python versions. Python 2.7 is still used, but support for it will stop in early 2020. Therefore this tutorial will use Python 3.

1. First will need to get Python 3. This [Installation Guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) should lead you through the process.

2. I recommend using [Atom](https://atom.io/) instead of a plain text editor. It provides syntax highlighting to indicate the functionality of a piece of code.

3. Once we have created a Python script _script.py_ we have to execute it on the command line. [This article](https://www.pythoncentral.io/execute-python-script-file-shell/) shows you how. After you navigated to the correct directory - on Windows this should look like:

```
C:\...\learn-python> python script.py
```

Linux and Mac users will see something like:

```
user@ubuntu:~/.../learn-python$ python script
```

- Alternatively you can use an [Online Interpreter](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_compiler) to run the code. This way you do not need to install anything, but code might run slower.

If you made it through the installation process, the cumbersome part is behind you and we can get started :)
