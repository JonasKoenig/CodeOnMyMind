# Machine Learning [still in progress]

Machine Learning is a part of the wider field of artificial intelligence (AI). It is an attempt to learn something from existing data (training data) and apply that knowledge to new data.

## Classification vs. Regression
Two major forms of machine learning are classification and regression. Classification aims to assign an object to one of several discrete categories based on data about said object. For example classify a dog's breed by looking at its height, weight, etc.

Regression on the other hand assigns a value from a continuous range of values. For instance estimating the price of a car by considering the brand, horsepower and gas mileage. Regression problems can be transformed into classification problems by choosing relevant intervals (`0$-15000$: cheap car, >15000$: expensive car`).
