# Machine Learning [still in progress]

Machine Learning is a part of the wider field of artificial intelligence (AI). It is an attempt to learn something from existing data (_training data_) and apply that knowledge to new data (_test data_).

## 1. What is it?
- AI
- NLP, Spam,
- Chess, Go, Starcraft, Hanabi
- X is input
- Y is output
- prediction function

## 2. Different Kinds

The different kinds of machine learning are distinguished by their input. Mainly, do we know the correct answer up front or not?

### Supervised Learning

In the supervised setting we have a dataset including the property we trying to learn. We try to link the input properties to their given output properties. Then we can predict the output property for any future data with their output property missing.



- classification
- regression

### Semi-Supervised Learning

### Unsupervised Learning
- clustering
- reduce dimensionality
- outlier detection

##### kNN

##### Classification vs. Regression
Two major forms of supervised learning are classification and regression. Classification aims to assign an object to one of several discrete categories based on data about said object. For example classify a dog's breed by looking at its height, weight, etc.

Regression on the other hand assigns a value from a continuous range of values. For instance estimating the price of a car by considering the brand, horsepower and gas mileage. Regression problems can be transformed into classification problems by choosing relevant intervals (`0$-15000$: cheap car, >15000$: expensive car`).
