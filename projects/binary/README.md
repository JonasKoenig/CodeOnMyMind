# Binary Information

One field in computer science is representing information in a way computers can understand them - zeros and ones. In this article, we will see relatively easy representations of numbers and text and touch on more complex image and video encodings.

## Numbers

The most widely used number system is the decimal system or the base-ten system. We have ten digits `0-9` and if we want to express a bigger number we add another digit. The position of each digit is essential to its value.

```
  243 = 2*100 + 4*10  + 3*1
      = 2*10¬≤ + 4*10¬π + 3*10‚Å∞
    --> 2       4       3
```

To determine the value of a number, each digit is multiplied by the power of ten corresponding to its position.

So far, we recapped the first grade üéì. Now for the binary system (base-two system): We are now constrained to only two digits `0` and `1`.

```
  243 = 1*128 + 1*64 + 1*32 + 1*16 + 0*8  + 0*4  + 1*2  + 1*1
      = 1*2‚Å∑  + 1*2‚Å∂ + 1*2‚Åµ + 1*2‚Å¥ + 0*2¬≥ + 0*2¬≤ + 1*2¬π + 1*2‚Å∞
    --> 1       1      1      1      0      0      1      1
```

Appending all binary digits from this decomposition yields the binary representation `11110011`.

We use the notation `(243)‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ = (11110011)‚ÇÇ` to distinguish the two systems. That is the number to binary conversion in a nutshell.

  We need 16 digits, so we keep `0-9` and add `A = 10`, `B = 11`, `C = 12`, `D = 13`, `E = 14` and `F = 15`.

  ```
    243 = 15*16  + 3*1
        = 15*16¬π + 3*16‚Å∞
        =  F*16¬π + 3*16‚Å∞
      -->  F       3
  ```

  So `(243)‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ = (F3)‚ÇÅ‚ÇÜ`.

## Text

Text conversion does not rely on calculation, but a conversion table.

The **ASCII** (*American Standard Code for Information Interchange*) uses 7 bits to encode characters and various control symbols.

| Character | Binary   |
|:---------:|:--------:|
| A         | 100 0001 |
| B         | 100 0010 |
| C         | 100 0011 |
| ...       | ...      |

A more modern approach is **UTF-8**, sometimes called Unicode. It includes more than the basic symbols. Therefore it needs longer bit sequences to differentiate between the characters.
