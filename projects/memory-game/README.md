# Memory Game

This project is a simple memory game I made for a friend. I decided to do it in JavaScript and CSS, because I did not know which machine this game was going to run on - and everyone has Browser to display HTML.

Before I even started I looked for implementations of others for this game. Using other peoples code cut my development time by at least a half. I was able to completely skip the game logic and the project was more about engineering the _feel_ and content of the game. See [this link](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-create-a-memory-game-super-mario-with-plain-javascript/) for the original project.
