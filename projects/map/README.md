# CO₂ Emission Map

🚧 work in progress 🚧

<!-- Just a side note upfront: Testing this project yourself is a little tricky. The reason being, that the processing library I use does not allow for loading local files. If you want to play around with the map you need to run the page on a local server. I did this by entering `python -m http.server` to my console, but that requires an installation.  -->
