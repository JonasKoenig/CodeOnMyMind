# CO‚ÇÇ Emission Map

<img src='media/screen.PNG' width='525px' />

Explore carbon footprints from all over the world in my interactive map. The annual CO‚ÇÇ emissions are visualized as a small fire. A larger the flame means a larger footprint. As we zoom the map reveals more information on each country.

The map is constructed using object-oriented programming. The file `script/map.js` holds the main loop for the animations. The fire animation iteself is made up of a particle emitter that spews out appropriately sized and colored particles (circles). I created a separate class for the tooltips that are revealed as we zoom in. 

### Libraries

The visualisations are created using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). A simple javascript framework for drawing on a canvas. [Mappa.js](https://mappa.js.org/) is a map library specifically designed for p5.js. Mappa provides several options for acquiring map data. Using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) is an easy way to connect to Open Street Maps.

### Data

All data was preprocessed using python. I use pandas dataframes to select columns of interest, filter data from 2020 and merge the CO‚ÇÇ data with the appropriate GPS coordinates (See: `data/compile.py`)

### Try it

You can use the map on my [GitHub Pages](https://jonaskoenig.github.io/CodeOnMyMind/projects/map/) or run it locally on your computer:

- Open terminal
- Navigate to folder `map`
- Execute `python -m http.server`
- Open `localhost:8000` in your browser

### Possible Extensions for the future

- I only used a fraction of the CO‚ÇÇ dataset. It also contains data for every year dating back to the 1950s. One possible extension would be to add a slider to select a specific year. This enables the user to compare emissions across five decades and see the development.

- CO‚ÇÇ is not the only relevant gas. Other greenhouse gases are also part of the dataset.

- In addition to single countries we can also compare entire continents.
