# Browser Data

üöß work in progress üöß

Hold onto your tinfoil hats! Browsers are our windows to the internet. Whenever you visit a web page, your browser sends a request to a server (See: [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)). In that request it specifies what documents or information the client (that's you) wants to see and where to send the response. As the web matured to accommodate more and more devices, these requests got more and more sophisticated. But what information about you is out there?

This project is an attempt to collect and visualize the information any server, you are in contact with, can see:

- Device
- Browser
- Language
- IP address (rough location)
- ...
